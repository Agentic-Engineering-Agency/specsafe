description: Start implementation (TEST → CODE)
---

Start implementation phase following TDD red-green-refactor.

**Usage:** `/specsafe-code <spec-id>`

**Example:** `/specsafe-code SPEC-20240204-001`

This moves the spec to CODE stage and guides TDD implementation.

**Next:** Run tests, implement, refactor. Then `/specsafe-qa <id>`
