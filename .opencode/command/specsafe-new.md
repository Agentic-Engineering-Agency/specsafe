description: Create a new SpecSafe specification
---

Create a new SpecSafe specification using the TDD workflow.

**Usage:** `/specsafe-new <spec-name>`

**Example:** `/specsafe-new user-authentication`

This will create a new spec in `specs/active/` with stage set to SPEC.

**Next:** Edit the spec, then run `/specsafe-test <id>`
