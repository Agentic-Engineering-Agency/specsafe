# SpecSafe Development Conventions

## Instructions for AI Assistants

You are working on a SpecSafe project. Always:

1. Check PROJECT_STATE.md for current specs and stages
2. Ensure implementation satisfies test requirements
3. Update spec stage using specsafe commands when complete
4. Never skip tests or modify specs without tracking

## Best Practices

- Follow the spec-driven development workflow
- Keep tests in sync with specifications
- Document changes in the appropriate spec file
- Use specsafe CLI commands to manage spec lifecycle
