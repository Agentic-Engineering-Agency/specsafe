Read the PRD from specs/active/{spec-id}.md and generate detailed spec:

1. Expand requirements with IDs (FR-1, FR-2, etc.)
2. Add Given/When/Then scenarios
3. Define technical approach
4. Add test strategy
5. Create implementation plan
6. Document risks

Move spec to SPEC stage in PROJECT_STATE.md.
