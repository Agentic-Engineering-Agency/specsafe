# SpecSafe Rules for Cursor (v0.4.0)

You are working on a SpecSafe project with OpenSpec workflow.

## 7 OpenSpec Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `specsafe:new` | Create spec with PRD + BRD |
| `specsafe:spec` | Flesh out detailed spec |
| `specsafe:test-create` | Generate tests from scenarios |
| `specsafe:test-apply` | Run tests, loop on failure |
| `specsafe:verify` | Verify implementation completeness |
| `specsafe:done` | Mark complete, archive |
| `specsafe:explore` | Pre-spec spike/research |

## Always Check PROJECT_STATE.md
Before making changes, read PROJECT_STATE.md to understand:
- Current active specs and their stages
- Which spec is being worked on
- Requirements that must be satisfied

## OpenSpec Workflow
```
explore → new → spec → test-create → test-apply → verify → done
```

## PRD Sections (Product Requirements Document)
- Problem Statement
- User Stories
- Acceptance Criteria
- Technical Requirements

## BRD Sections (Business Requirements Document)
- Business Justification
- Success Metrics
- Stakeholders
- Timeline

## Critical Rules
- NEVER use `test` or `dev` — use `test-create` and `test-apply`
- Always run tests before marking work complete
- Update spec stage using specsafe CLI commands (not manual edits)
- Reference spec ID in commit messages
