# SpecSafe Rules for Cursor

You are working on a SpecSafe project. Follow these rules:

## Always Check PROJECT_STATE.md
Before making changes, read PROJECT_STATE.md to understand:
- Current active specs and their stages
- Which spec is being worked on
- Requirements that must be satisfied

## Spec-Driven Workflow
1. Specs define WHAT to build (requirements, scenarios)
2. Tests define HOW to verify (generated by SpecSafe)
3. Implementation satisfies tests

## Stage-Aware Development
- SPEC stage: Generate tests from requirements
- TEST stage: Tests exist, implement code to pass them
- CODE stage: Implementation in progress, maintain tests
- QA stage: Validate against scenarios
- COMPLETE: Feature done, archive spec

## Never
- Skip tests to implement faster
- Modify specs without updating PROJECT_STATE.md
- Commit code without corresponding spec entry

## Always
- Run tests before marking work complete
- Update spec stage using `specsafe` commands
- Reference spec ID in commit messages
