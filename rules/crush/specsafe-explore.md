Pre-Spec Exploration and Research Mode

Guide the user through pre-spec research and validation before committing to a full specification.

**Activities:**
- Define the problem being solved
- Identify target users and their needs
- Research existing solutions and competitors
- Evaluate technology options with pros/cons
- Estimate effort (S/M/L/XL)
- Identify risks and constraints

**Output:** Create `specs/exploration/FEATURE-NAME.md` with:
- Problem statement and hypothesis
- User research findings
- Technology evaluation matrix
- Effort estimate and rationale
- Recommendation: proceed, research more, or park idea

**Decision Gate:** Recommend whether to proceed to `/specsafe:new` or gather more information.
