Pre-spec exploration and research

You are conducting preliminary exploration before committing to a full spec. This helps validate ideas and reduce unknowns.

1. **Exploration Prompts**
   Guide user through discovery:
   - What problem are we solving?
   - Who are the primary users?
   - What are the existing solutions/competitors?
   - What are the technical constraints?
   - What are the unknowns or risks?

2. **Research Tasks**
   Based on user input, help with:
   - Technology evaluation (pros/cons of options)
   - API documentation review
   - Similar feature analysis
   - Feasibility assessment
   - Effort estimation (T-shirt sizes: S, M, L, XL)

3. **Exploration Outputs**
   Document findings in:
   - `specs/exploration/FEATURE-NAME.md` — Research notes
   - Include: findings, recommendations, open questions
   - Attach relevant links, references

4. **Decision Gate**
   After exploration, help user decide:
   - Proceed to `specsafe-new` for full spec creation
   - Needs more research (schedule follow-up)
   - Deprioritize/park the idea

5. **Spike Code** (Optional)
   If technical validation needed:
   - Create spike branch
   - Write minimal proof-of-concept
   - Document learnings, then discard or keep

6. **Summary**
   Provide concise recommendation:
   - Go/No-go decision
   - Key risks identified
   - Suggested approach
   - Next steps

Ask: "What would you like to explore?"
